* Old: [lobaro/restic-backup-docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/lobaro/restic-backup-docker/)

Latest master (experimental):
```
docker pull ghcr.io/lobaro/restic-backup-docker:master
```

Latest release:

# Contributing
Pull Requests to improve the image are always wellcome. Please create an issue about the PR first.

When behaviour of the image changes (Features, Bugfixes, Changes in the API) please update the "Unreleased" section of the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/lobaro/restic-backup-docker/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)


## Hooks

If you need to execute a script before or after each backup or check, you need to add your hook scripts in the container folder `/hooks`:
```
-v ~/home/user/hooks:/hooks
```

Call your pre-backup script `pre-backup.sh` and post-backup script `post-backup.sh`. You can also have separate scripts when running data verification checks `pre-check.sh` and `post-check.sh`.

Please don't hesitate to report any issues you find. **Thanks.**

# Test the container

Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Lobaro/restic-backup-docker.git
cd restic-backup-docker
```

Build the container (the container is named `backup-test`):
```
./build.sh
```

Run the container:
```
./run.sh
```

This will run the container `backup-test` with the name  `backup-test`. Existing containers with that name are completely removed automatically.

The container will back up `~/test-data` to a repository with password `test` at `~/test-repo` every minute. The repository is initialized automatically by the container. If you'd like to change the arguments passed to `restic init`, you can do so using the `RESTIC_INIT_ARGS` env variable.

To enter your container execute:
```
docker exec -ti backup-test /bin/sh
```

Now you can use restic [as documented](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), e.g. try to run `restic snapshots` to list all your snapshots.

## Logfiles
Logfiles are inside the container. If needed, you can create volumes for them.
```
docker logs
```
Shows `/var/log/cron.log`.

Additionally you can see the full log, including restic output, of the last execution in `/var/log/backup-last.log`. When the backup fails, the log is copied to `/var/log/restic-error-last.log`. If configured, you can find the full output of the mail notification in `/var/log/mail-last.log`.

# Use the running container

Assuming the container name is `restic-backup-var`, you can execute restic with:

    docker exec -ti restic-backup-var restic

## Backup

To execute a backup manually, independent of the CRON, run:

    docker exec -ti restic-backup-var /bin/backup
    
Back up a single file or directory:

    docker exec -ti restic-backup-var restic backup /data/path/to/dir --tag my-tag

## Data verification check

To verify backup integrity and consistency manually, independent of the CRON, run:

    docker exec -ti restic-backup-var /bin/check

## Restore

You might want to mount a separate host volume at e.g. `/restore` to not override existing data while restoring. 

Get your snapshot ID with:

    docker exec -ti restic-backup-var restic snapshots
    
e.g. `abcdef12`

     docker exec -ti restic-backup-var restic restore --include /data/path/to/files --target / abcdef12

The target is `/` since all data backed up should be inside the host mounted `/data` dir. If you mount `/restore` you should set `--target /restore` and the data will end up in `/restore/data/path/to/files`.

# Customize the Container

The container is set up by setting [environment variables](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#/env-environment-variables) and [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#volume-shared-filesystems).

## Environment variables

* `RESTIC_REPOSITORY` - the location of the restic repository. Default `/mnt/restic`. For S3: `s3:https://s3.amazonaws.com/BUCKET_NAME`
* `RESTIC_PASSWORD` - the password for the restic repository. Will also be used for restic init during first start when the repository is not initialized.
* `RESTIC_TAG` - Optional. To tag the images created by the container.
* `NFS_TARGET` - Optional. If set, the given NFS is mounted, i.e. `mount -o nolock -v ${NFS_TARGET} /mnt/restic`. `RESTIC_REPOSITORY` must remain its default value!
* `BACKUP_CRON` - A cron expression to run the backup. Note: The cron daemon uses UTC time zone. Default: `0 */6 * * *` aka every 6 hours.
* `CHECK_CRON` - Optional. A cron expression to run data integrity check (`restic check`). If left unset, data will not be checked. Note: The cron daemon uses UTC time zone. Example: `0 23 * * 3` to run 11PM every Tuesday.
* `PRUNE_CRON` - Optional. A cron expression to Remove unneeded data from the repository (`restic prune`). If left unset, data will not be prune.
* `RESTIC_FORGET_ARGS` - Optional. Only if specified, `restic forget` is run with the given arguments after each backup. Example value: `-e "RESTIC_FORGET_ARGS=--prune --keep-last 10 --keep-hourly 24 --keep-daily 7 --keep-weekly 52 --keep-monthly 120 --keep-yearly 100"`
* `RESTIC_INIT_ARGS` - Optional. Allows specifying extra arguments to `restic init` such as a password file with `--password-file`.
* `RESTIC_JOB_ARGS` - Optional. Allows specifying extra arguments to the backup job such as limiting bandwith with `--limit-upload` or excluding file masks with `--exclude`.
* `RESTIC_DATA_SUBSET` - Optional. You can pass a value to `--read-data-subset` when a repository check is run. If left unset, only the structure of the repository is verified. Note: `CHECK_CRON` must be set for check to be run automatically.
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - Optional. When using restic with AWS S3 storage.
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - Optional. When using restic with AWS S3 storage.
* `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` - Optional. If specified, the content of `/var/log/backup-last.log` and `/var/log/check-last.log` is sent to your Microsoft Teams channel after each backup and data integrity check.
* `MAILX_ARGS` - Optional. If specified, the content of `/var/log/backup-last.log` and `/var/log/check-last.log` is sent via mail after each backup and data integrity check using an *external SMTP*. To have maximum flexibility, you have to specify the mail/smtp parameters on your own. Have a look at the [mailx manpage](https://linux.die.net/man/1/mailx) for further information. Example value: `-e "MAILX_ARGS=-r 'from@example.de' -s 'Result of the last restic run' -S smtp='smtp.example.com:587' -S smtp-use-starttls -S smtp-auth=login -S smtp-auth-user='username' -S smtp-auth-password='password' 'to@example.com'"`.
* `OS_AUTH_URL` - Optional. When using restic with OpenStack Swift container.
* `OS_PROJECT_ID` - Optional. When using restic with OpenStack Swift container.
* `OS_PROJECT_NAME` - Optional. When using restic with OpenStack Swift container.
* `OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME` - Optional. When using restic with OpenStack Swift container.
* `OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_ID` - Optional. When using restic with OpenStack Swift container.
* `OS_USERNAME` - Optional. When using restic with OpenStack Swift container.
* `OS_PASSWORD` - Optional. When using restic with OpenStack Swift container.
* `OS_REGION_NAME` - Optional. When using restic with OpenStack Swift container.
* `OS_INTERFACE` - Optional. When using restic with OpenStack Swift container.
* `OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION` - Optional. When using restic with OpenStack Swift container.
  
NEW Env For Database Dump
* `DATABASE_TYPE` - Optional. Specify the database type (mongo/mongodb/mysql/pg/postgres/postgresql). Specifying this option will enable the database backup function.
* `DATABASE_BACKUP_TIME` - Optional. Database backup is automatically enabled within the specified time range (default 0-23)
* `DATABASE_HOST` - Optional. Database host address
* `DATABASE_PORT` - Optional. Database host port (if not specified, it will automatically follow the default port value of the database type)
* `DATABASE_NAME` - Optional. Database name, Supports specifying multiple database names separated by ','. If not specified all database tables (except system tables) are used by default. Database type **mysql** AND **postgresql** MUST set. 
* `DATABASE_USER` - Optional. Database Username
* `DATABASE_PASSWORD` - Optional. Database password

## Volumes

* `/data` - This is the data that gets backed up. Just [mount](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#volume-shared-filesystems) it to wherever you want.

## Set the hostname

Since restic saves the hostname with each snapshot and the hostname of a docker container is derived from its id, you might want to customize this by setting the hostname of the container to another value.

Set `--hostname` in the [network settings](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#network-settings)

## Backup via SFTP

Since restic needs a **passwordless login** to the SFTP server, make sure you can do `sftp user@host` from inside the container. If you can do so from your host system, the easiest way is to just mount your `.ssh` folder containing the authorized cert into the container by specifying `-v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh` as an argument for `docker run`.

Now you can simply specify the restic repository to be an [SFTP repository](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Manual/#create-an-sftp-repository).

```
-e "RESTIC_REPOSITORY=sftp:user@host:/tmp/backup"
```

## Backup via OpenStack Swift

Restic can back up data to an OpenStack Swift container. Because Swift supports various authentication methods, credentials are passed through environment variables. In order to help integration with existing OpenStack installations, the naming convention of those variables follows the official Python Swift client.

Now you can simply specify the restic repository to be a [Swift repository](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#openstack-swift).

```
-e "RESTIC_REPOSITORY=swift:backup:/"
-e "RESTIC_PASSWORD=password"
-e "OS_AUTH_URL=https://auth.cloud.ovh.net/v3"
-e "OS_PROJECT_ID=xxxx"
-e "OS_PROJECT_NAME=xxxx"
-e "OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=Default"
-e "OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_ID=default"
-e "OS_USERNAME=username"
-e "OS_PASSWORD=password"
-e "OS_REGION_NAME=SBG"
-e "OS_INTERFACE=public"
-e "OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3"
```

## Backup via rclone

To use rclone as a backend for restic, simply add the rclone config file as a volume with `-v /absolute/path/to/rclone.conf:/root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`.

Note that for some backends (Among them Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive), rclone writes data back to the `rclone.conf` file. In this case it needs to be writable by Docker.

If the container fails to write the new `rclone.conf` file with the error message `Failed to save config after 10 tries: Failed to move previous config to backup location`, add the entire `rclone` directory as a volume: `-v /absolute/path/to/rclone-dir:/root/.config/rclone`.

## Example docker-compose

This is an example `docker-compose.yml`. The container will back up two directories to an SFTP server and check data integrity once a week.
